# first-discord-bot-with-nodejs
This is my first ever discord bot. A very basic command handler is used and the bot can do some very basic tasks like replying to certain messages, sending welcome
messages and remembering manually set welcome messages for different servers, kicking and banning members, muting members and some more. Throughout the project, 
I mostly followed the discordjs tutorial from the youtube channel Worn Off Keys.

Some other JavaScript libraries besides discord.js were used for different purposes.
